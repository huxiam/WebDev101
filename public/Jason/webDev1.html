  <h1>Web Development</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This is part 2 of web development, and if you didn't see "programming", or "web development (part 1)"
  , then, don't see this or else you wont understand. I know in part 1 I forgot to make a paragraph for
  JS, except it was on purpose, and so I decided that I would write the JS paragraph in part 2.</p><hr>
  
  <h2>JavaScript or JS</h2>
    
  <p>Well, here is the JS paragraph. 
  JS is a programming language that can be used if you want to do complex things, like delaying things,
  go to another website automaticaly or maybe you couldnt find any psuedo classes in CSS. You can change a
  class even when the button's "onclick" atribute can't manipulate CSS files, you can use a querySelector.
  Sounds complicated, and for me, it is, because im a JS noob, and a CSS & HTML noob too. But I built this
  website, so im not completely a failure. I'm going off-track, anyway JS runs kind of like Python, there is
  no "main" function that the computer runs, it just runs, no main function required. The "syntax" for Js is
  kind of like a hybrid of C# and Kotlin. So if you're good at those and you want to make a website, search up
  a tutorial on HTML, CSS, and JS. I will warn you, if you want to make a website like this, you're going
  to need to type, a lot. However if JS has an error in a
  website, it wont have an error message, it will just not work! And if you are making a website at all, the
  only logical things you will encounter is JS, and nothing else.</p><hr>

  <h2>PHP</h2>
  <p>Most people nowadays don't use PHP because we think that JS is a better version of PHP,
  well, I do in fact think PHP is outdated, but JS is a very hard to learn language. So if
  you are a begginer, you should probably learn PHP because then you get prepared for web
  development conceps before you dive straight into JS, because then you will have familiar
  syntax, which basically means ou get more practice, so if you know PHP, then learning JS
  will probably be a lot easier. PHP has an "echo" command like bash but you can put html
  <strong>Tags</strong> inside the quotes, and yes, PHP uses quotes. so you can make a button
  without using HTML, you just use PHP! But using PHP for that is very unintelligent, so don't.</p>
