    <h1>Cooking With Science</h1>
    <h2>Introduction<br></h2>
    <p>Cooking involves a lot more science than you might expect.
    First, you need to know about two types of changes to food:
    physical changes, and chemical changes. Phisical changes take
    lots of effort to revert, but chemical changes are imposible to
    reverse. For example: if you chop a carrot, you could put it back
    together if you tried hard enough, but if you burn a carrot, you
    cannot turn it back into a raw carrot no matter what you do.<hr>
    </p>
    <h2>Cooking Processes</h2>
    <p>When you cook meat, it turns from pink into brown, this is because the protiens change flavor and color.
    But, if you cook the meat even more, it turns black, because a chemical reaction occurs and it turns meat
    black. This reaction also turns slimy eggs into hard cooked eggs. There is another cooking reaction that 
    turns acidic, crunchy raw onions into soft, sweet cooked onions. it is also how caramel is made.</p><hr>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Cooking might seem simple, you get some stuff and you heat it up, but in fact, cooking uses lots of complex
    chemical reactions. Maybe you already know about the complex chemical reactions required to cook food or maybe
    you thought this document was reviewing cooking recipies, and if you did, then you thought wrong.</p>
