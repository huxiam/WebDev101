  <h1>Web Development</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>

  <p>Web development is making websites, like this one. Websites can have lots of elements that do
  different things, HTML is the web development language, CSS decorates HTML, and JavaScript, also
  known as JS was made for adding functionality to HTML. There are the areas you need to manage when
  making a website, Front-end, which is the content showed on screen, Back-end, which is for adding
  functionality to the website, and the database, used for managing data. If you are making a simple
  website, the database is useless. On the other hand, if you are making a large scale website, then
  you will need to use the database a lot. But if you don't know anything about programming at all,
  then go back to the main menu and check out "Programming", or this document might not make any sense
  </p><hr><h2>HTML</h2>
  
  <p>Html uses tags that look like this <>, There can be content within these tags, but it is hard to
  display them, so i will use {} in place of them, so don't be confused. You can display a heading by
  doing {h1}Content{/h1} There needs to be a "/" inside the closing tag. You can also put classes and
  stuff <strong>Inside</strong> the tags, like this: {thing class="Whatever"} Content {/thing}, if this
  is confusing, then you will get the hang of it if you learn it.<hr><h2>CSS</h2> CSS however doesn't use <>, they use
  the real {}, you can modify an id you put inside a tag or a class, like this: <br><br>.className {<br>
  color: Blue or whatever;<br>
  } <br><br>This is called a "rule", each rule modifies the look of an HTML tag, for example, it could
  change the color or the size of a button. There are also psuedo classes like hover, which modifies the
  style of a tag if your cursor hovers over it. There are a lot more psuedo classes out there, so if you
  decide to write some JS, you could save lots of time if you use a psuedo class.</p><hr>
