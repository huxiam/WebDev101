  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Programming is a very complicated thing. To get you up to speed, there is a console
  that can display text, just plain text. You can "print" something to the console. For
  <br><br>example: print("Hello")<br><br>
  Prints "Hello" to the console, the "print()" prints the things inside of the ( ),
  but it will be text if it has quotes, but if not, then it's refering to a variable.</p><hr>
  <h2>Python</h2>
  <p>Python is a very simple language for beginners, but it can do very complex thing if you
  get very experienced, like AI and Machine learning. It is made to resemble plain english,
  also, that example in the intro was an actual line of python! If you want to make a variable
  , then you just write the variable name, an equals sign, and then the value after.<br><br>For
  example: name = "Joe"<br><br>This creates a variable called "name" that has the value of "Joe",
  now you can use this variable in a function. Yes it is just like functions in math.<br><br>For example: print(name)<br><br>This prints 
 the value of "name"
  to the console, if you were the "interpreter", or the machine that does things with code, you would read
  the print(name) and realise that there is a variable called "name", and the value of "name" is
  "Joe", so you prints "Joe" to the screen.</p><hr>
  <h2>Bash</h2>
  <p>Normaly, I don't use this much, so i'm going to talk about it for some reason.
  To print something, you use:<br><br>echo hello<br><br>And for some reason, you don't use
  quotes, actualy, you can't even if you wanted to! Also, there are no ( ). I don't know
  how to make variables, don't ask.</p>
