  <h1>Plant World</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This document will introduce you to some of the plants in the world
  and will tell you some information about the plants, too. Each paragraph
  will tell you about one plant each, and this is not the only document
  explaining plants, there will be many other documents that explain plants
  as well.</p>

  <h2>Bananas</h2>
  <p>Bananas are well known for their extremely curvy shape, have you ever wondered how such curve is possible?
  Well, the reason that bananas are curved is because the tree was blocking the sun, so they had to curve to
  have a decent supply of sun to live. All the other bananas that weren't curvy <em>ceased to exist</em>, so only the
  curvy bananas were left. The reason that after a long time, the banana turns black and mushy, is because there
  is a chemical that makes bananas ripe. The chemical doesn't know when to stop, so it just keeps going until it
  turns disgusting and no one wants to eat it anymore</p><hr>
  <h2>Apples</h2>
  <p>Apples are the third most popular fruit in the entire world, with north america producing 2500 different
  types of apples. That doesn't come close to the over <strong>7000</strong> types of apples all over the world!
  Even though those 7000 apples are 25% air.
  They suprisingly are in the rose family with apricots and cherries. There once was a man named <strong>
  Johnny Appleseed</strong>, not his real name, but he did plant lots of apple seeds, so it all checks out.</p>
