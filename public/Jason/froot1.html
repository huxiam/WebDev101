  <h1>Plant World</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>If you haven't read part 1 of plant world, then read it,
  and continue from here. You already know that this will be
  showcasing 2 plants. Each paragraph will showcase one
  plant, and one plant only. There will only be another plant
  if it is essential to explaining the plant.</p><hr>
  <h2>Orange</h2>
  <p>The word orange actually comes from arabic, they are also
  a very good source of vitamin C. They are also a 
 <strong>Hybrid</strong>
  of mandarin(a fruit) and pomelo. Only 20% of oranges are 
 sold as
  oranges, the other 80% are used in making extracts, and 
 juice. A fully
  grown orange tree can be <em>tall</em>, up to 30 feet in 
 height.
  Travelers used to carry lots of oranges to prevent scurvy 
 from attacking
  their body<hr>

  <hr><p>Oranges actually prevents kidney stones from 
 forming, so if you're scared about
  kidney stones, you better stock up on oranges. Or fruits 
 related to oranges in some way, like pomelo, mandarin
  , and tangirines.</p><hr>
  <h2>Chocolate</h2>
  <p>Yes, chocolate is a plant! I will go more in depth in 
 another document I will
  make in the future, but all you need to know is that 
 chocolate is made on a tree
  called the <em>Cacao</em> tree, and there 
    are pods 
 that 
 need to be choped open
  with a machete in order to make chocolate, and there are 
  lots of seeds inside
  a pod. I think it's around 200, yes, that is a lot. Can I
  belive bean shaped
  seeds are used to make chocolate? No, I cannot. But it is
  true.</p>
